\title{rsthemes: Full Themes for RStudio v1.2+}
\description{
This package provides a set of complete RStudio themes that restyle the
IDE and the editor syntax. The themes are built from
\href{https://sass-lang.org}{sass} templates into \code{.rstheme} files that,
ultimately, contain the CSS files that provide the themes. The sass templates
provide an easy-to-extend framework for customizing the look of RStudio. If
you would like to create your own theme, \code{\link[=rstheme]{rstheme()}} is designed to help you
get started quickly.
